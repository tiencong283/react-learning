Setting the Search Bar's State
Welcome to the third part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the second part of this project. You:

    Moved business information to the container component (App)
    Passed information from parent components (App) to child components (BusinessList, Business)

In this project, you’ll complete the third part of Ravenous: Setting the State of Ravenous Components.

Certain components will need to handle changes in their state. For example, the sorting options in the search bar will change (and we’ll need to know their state when communicating with the Yelp API). The same goes for the two input elements. These are the kinds of changes you’ll handle in this project.
