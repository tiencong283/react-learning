From Codecademy.com "Create a Front-End App with React" project

Welcome to the first installment of the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:
    Creating Static Components
    Passing Information to Components
    Setting the State of Ravenous Components
    Interacting with the Yelp API

Today, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: Creating Static Components.

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:
    As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
    As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
    As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.



Let’s briefly review what you built:
    A Business component that simulates a single business
    A BusinessList component that simulates a list of single businesses
    A SearchBar component that will be used in the future to search for business

The App component renders a SearchBar component and a BusinessList component. The final product is a simulation of how the Ravenous project will look and work. Some functionality (like querying the Yelp API) is currently missing, but you’ll build it in the upcoming projects.
Reflect on the knowledge you used in this project. As you do so, consider the following question:
    At the moment, some information (like business information) is hard coded into specific components. How might you pass this information dynamically between components?
