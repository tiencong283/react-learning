Random Color Picker (codecademy.com "Create a Front-End App with React" project)

In this project, we’ll build a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.
Our program will set the screen’s background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color. Random generators are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.
