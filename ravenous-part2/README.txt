From Codecademy.com "Create a Front-End App with React" project

Welcome to the second part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the first part of this project. You:

    Used create-react-app to start your project
    Built all of the components you’ll need for the remainder of the project
    Simulated what Ravenous should look like after returning search results

In this project, you’ll complete the second part of Ravenous: Passing Information to Components.

So far, you’ve hard coded business information and rendered it manually. Now we’ll focus on how information (like business information) can pass from component to component with less hard coding. This is crucial as we build towards the goal of constructing a Yelp-like clone.

Let’s review what you’ve done so far:

    Moved business information to App.js
    Created a list of businesses using an array, rather than repeating components in BusinessList.js
    Built functionality for the BusinessList component to iterate through the array and return Business components
