Interacting with the Yelp API
Welcome to the fourth and final part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the third part of this project. You:
    Set the state of search bar elements
    Simulated a search query

In this project, you’ll complete the fourth part of Ravenous: Interacting with the Yelp API.
So far, Ravenous is mostly static. Clicking on the “Let’s Go” button doesn’t retrieve results from the Yelp API. We’ll need that functionality to complete Ravenous. This project will ask that you build this functionality.
